# Rails App with Dockerized Monitoring Stack

This project contains a Ruby on Rails application working with PostgreSQL and Redis databases and all of them containerized with Docker and extended with a complete monitoring stack using Prometheus, Grafana as well as Redis Exporter, PostgreSQL Exporter, and Alertmanager.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Infrastructure Overview

The infrastructure is fully containerized using **Docker Compose**, allowing seamless orchestration of multiple services:

- **Rails App** â€“ The core web application.
- **PostgreSQL** â€“ Primary relational database.
- **Redis** â€“ In-memory data store.
- **Prometheus** â€“ Metrics collection and storage.
- **Grafana** â€“ Visualization of metrics and alert statuses.
- **Alertmanager** â€“ Routing and notification of alerts.
- **Exporters** â€“ Specialized exporters for Redis, PostgreSQL, and Rails metrics.

All services communicate through a shared Docker network and are defined in a single `docker-compose.yml` file to ensure consistency and portability.
